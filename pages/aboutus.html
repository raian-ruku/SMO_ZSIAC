        <h1>SOCIAL MEDIA OLYMPIAD</h1><br><br>
       <p> <q>Social media is not media. The key is to listen, engage, and build relationships.” --- David Alston, author</q><br><br>Social media means Facebook, Instagram, etc. And our parents understand that it's just a waste of time. Is social media just a waste of time? Is it just an exaggeration? No! To prove this fact, Zenith Science and IT aiming club have arranged a unique olympiad named “Social Media Olympiad”. <br>It's a very newly formed initiative taken by us. We are gonna write history in the olympiad world. For the first time in the world, we are going to organize this type of olympiad. <br>Participants will learn new concepts and ideas that could help to boost their confidence which will also help them to shape their future in this exciting field by putting their skills to use.  The Social Media Olympiad-SMO will be a fantastic journey with the motto "We Empower the Power of Next Generation '' with a large number of students.
